Hi! Welcome to my new blog. I don't really know what I am going to put here, because I haven't blogged in so long that I feel mostly like I have nothing worth saying.

I wanted to learn some React, and Gatsby seemed like a cool way to use React as sort of a framework for building simple websites. I'm only in the beginning stages, but components seem like a very nice thing for web development, and being able to compartmentalize the CSS by component also seems really cool, if a little unusual compared to the mammoth CSS files I've been building since 1998.

I also wanted to shift my hosting over something that will essentially be free, so this site is hosted on S3 using Cloudfront. It's kind of neat, since I can just push commits to the master branch on Github and Travis-CI will handle generating the site and pushing it to S3 for me. It's not quite as simple as using Wordpress but it's still pretty cool, and way more performant and secure. I'll write up another post with how I got it running.
