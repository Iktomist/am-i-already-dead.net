When I was growing up, I didn't want to be a programmer, which didn't really make sense considering what my interests were as a kid. I first got a computer when I was 11 years old, back in 1996 (a Compaq Presario, Pentium 166), and when we got it hooked up to the internet (AT&T Worldnet) I don't remember wasting much time before deciding I wanted to build a website.

I downloaded [The Barebones Guide to HTML](http://werbach.com/barebones/), printed out the text-only version (printing stuff off the internet was an early favorite passtime of mine), and got to work cranking out my only little Geocities website. After that it seems like I felt accomplished, because I didn't bother making another website again until 1999, when The Blair Witch project came out and I felt obligated to [make a website for it](https://web.archive.org/web/19991127182214/http://www.blairwoods.com/).

A couple months after this, I discovered this new thing going around called "blogging", and started using Blogger to post my own, teenager-styled thoughts online. Maybe I'll cover my relationship with blogging as a teen in another post, because it was a little crazy.

Around this time friends and family started telling me, "You should be a web developer!" My response was always the same, from my teens into my twenties: "No way, that's way too much work. Besides, sometimes I end up pulling my hair out for hours trying to get my websites working, why would I want to do something like that as a job?" I feel like a lot of problems in the first two and a half decades of my life could be attributed to this stance, that if something wasn't easy, I simply didn't want to do it. This is most likely why I ended up dropping out of high school, and, later, dropping out of college.

However, web development never stopped being something I did as a hobby, strictly for myself. I was essentially addicted to blogging or journalling my thoughts on the internet. I ran several different blogs over the course of my teens and twenties, eventually moving on from Blogger to a variety of platforms and software: Livejournal, Greymatter, Movable Type, b2, and finally Wordpress.

Until to my shift to Wordpress, I didn't have to learn any programming beyond HTML and CSS. However, the desire to create more elaborate designs for my blogs necessitated that I learn some PHP, if just so that I could have multiple 'loops' for different kinds of posts to display on a page at once. This is probably how a lot of web developers end up dipping their toes into more elaborate programming, but I still only ever did the minimum amount necessary and didn't consider myself a 'real programmer'.

The idea that there is such a thing as a 'real programmer' always held me back. So what if I could program basically anything in HTML and CSS? I knew that these things were not a 'real' programming language. When I learned some PHP to build better Wordpress templates for myself, I assumed that the amount of knowledge I was gaining was always a tiny glimmer compared to the knowledge that a 'real programmer' would have. I assumed I simply did not have what it took to be a 'real' programmer, especially because everything I did know was so hard to learn, and that even applying that knowledge was often an exercise in frustration until I stumbled upon victory.

## Lesson one: You, too, can be a 'real' programmer

There's no hidden knowledge, no gnosis, for being a real programmer.
