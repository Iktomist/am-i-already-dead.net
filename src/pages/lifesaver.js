              Life Saver is an abstract Apple TV app and free macOS screensaver
              based on{" "}
              <a href="https://www.github.com/amiantos/lifesaver">
                Conway's Game of Life
              </a>
              . With a variety of settings and color schemes, Life Saver should
              satisfy designers and geeks alike.

            <h2>Apple TV</h2>
            <p>
              Life Saver is now on Apple TV! In this version there are some
              extra configuration settings not found in the screensaver version,
              that lead to a greater variety in visuals, including the new
              "Technicolor Dream" preset which I think is totally amazing.

            <h2>What is Open Source?</h2>
            <p>
              Life Saver is fully "open source". That means if you want, you can
              download the source code, compile it with Xcode, and play with it
              for free. You can also use its code in your own projects, or make
              your own versions of Life Saver with extra options that you think
              are cool. For more information, check out{" "}

              . If you like Life Saver, please consider starring it as well.

              more unique projects by me, please consider{" "}
