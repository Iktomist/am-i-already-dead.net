Howdy! This is my weekly post where I talk about what I did over the past week. I've been taking the quarantine pretty easy, mostly playing games, but this past week I've started to get *the itch* to start building something again. What that is, I don't know yet, but I'm preparing...

## SwiftUI

This weekend I started into Paul Hudson's [SwiftUI By Example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/) article series to learn SwiftUI. I figure whatever app or game I build next could use SwiftUI without much trouble, as the bits of interface missing from SwiftUI aren't going to be important to me (I think). I credit Paul Hudson's **Hacking with Swift** series with my being an iOS developer, and possibly with my being a professional developer at all, so I am excited to dive back into his content. (I am not shy about [singing Paul Hudon's praises](https://twitter.com/amiantos/status/1233427637093011457). He is a great teacher and seems to be a great person all around.)

I don't have much to report here yet, because I literally just began last night, but so far I can say that SwiftUI is definitely quite the paradigm shift for iOS development. I just got used to AutoLayout, and made the decision that I prefer XIBs over Storyboards and programmatic UI, and now I gotta get used to something *very* different! Seems very cool though, the fact that a lot of the fiddly bits of dealing with UITableViewCells and such are abstracted away should make app development significantly easier for 90% of the apps on the market. iOS app development in a couple years is going to be *very* streamlined, I think.

## Mentoring?

Someone learning to program iOS apps reached out to me late this week to ask if I was open to getting contributions for [Gamebook Engine](https://github.com/amiantos/gamebookengine), because they liked the idea of the project and wanted to get some solid experience working on other apps.

I said yes, and now it appears I am somewhat mentoring someone who hopes to break into iOS engineering! This is *really* cool, but also a bit daunting. While I am a "professional engineer", my corporate experience lies in Python API development, and not iOS, so there's a touch of impostor syndrome in me about how qualified I am to teach someone iOS development. On the other hand, I do feel that I am fairly strong iOS programmer, and at the very least I can teach an up-and-comer some valuable insight into what it's like to work as part of a team.

I don't have much to say here either as the process just began, but so far this individual seems to have a pretty good understanding of iOS fundamentals and is off to a strong start on handling the implementation of some features in Gamebook Engine that I hadn't gotten to myself. It might be weird to say, but it feels nice to see one of my projects progressing without my direct effort!

That's really about it for me this week. See you next week (maybe)!
