The other day I was trying to remember anything I may have forgotten that happened to me in 2019, and remembered something. This made me feel like it could be fun to try to compile a list of "significant" things that happened to me in 2019. It might be challenging, because outside of the Photos app on my phone I'm not sure how I'll recreate the year. Let's see how it goes!

## March 25th - Broken Clavicle

Early in the year I'd started riding my bicycle to work. On the way back from lunch, as I went to turn right into my office complex, another cyclist decided to try to pass me on the right. I crashed into them and went down hard on my right shoulder. When I got up, I thought I was fine and just confused from the crash, so I waved the guy off (he was fine, didn't even fall off his bike). Only a minute later I realized I couldn't really move my arm.

I ended up having a broken clavicle, one that would have required surgery if not for some ligaments keeping the bones together without tearing. My recovery was long and painful, because all I had to do was hold my arm in one place and ensure I didn't tear those ligaments on accident. They gave me some Tylenol with codeine which did little to nothing for the pain.

I spent a couple weeks mostly just lying in bed as still as I could, with pillows propping me up in strategic places. During the first week I did a lot of what my girlfriend called "labor breathing" every time I moved around, just dealing with the pain. It was _not_ fun at all. I don't recommend it.

## July 3rd - Bought a Motorcycle

It might not make sense that after breaking my shoulder I would get a motorcycle, which is considerably more dangerous. And I agree, it does not make sense. I wasn't planning on it. My girlfriend wanted to go to motorcycle school so she could get a scooter, and I agreed to go with her for fun. When we finished the class, we'd switched places: I wanted a motorcycle and she didn't really want to ride anymore.

I got my motorcycle, a Genuine Motorcycles G400c, and spent a couple weekends riding it around Los Angeles' windier roads to get comfortable. Now it's just what I take on my 5 minute commutes back and forth from work. Is motorcycling scary? Definitely. At first it was absolutely terrifying. Now it's merely scary, and I'm very much aware of the fact that even if I ride as carefully as humanly possible (and I do, mostly), every ride is rolling the dice on some distracted driver plastering me across the front of their car. It's a sobering thought, but still I persist.
